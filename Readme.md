# Code for Selected-1 in Computer Science Course (FCIH)

## Numerical dataset chosen [Milk Quality Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cpluzshrijayan/milkquality)
### Used Logistic Regression and SVM for prediction [CODE](./numerical/selected-numeric.ipynb)


## Image dataset [Age Estimation](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/)
### Used SVM  [CODE](./image/Selected1_Image_SVM.ipynb)  and ANN  [CODE](./image/selected-image-ann.ipynb) for prediction
#### Used HoG Features for preprocessing Images in both

## Results and Configurations are in [report](./report.pdf)
